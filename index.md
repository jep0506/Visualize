 -      <h2>The Digital Divide</h2>
 -      <p> States that have a higher percentage of people that have no internet access have been found to be the states with lower qualities of education. The map below shows that New Mexico (47.4 percent) and Mississippi (49.7 percent) are the two states that have the most people without internet access. This correlates with state education quality scores released by Education Week for 2016, where these states are ranked as the 49th and 50th respectively out of 51 (including D.C.). The only state that scored worse in education was Nevada, where 36.8 percent of the population is unable to connect to the internet at home.</p>

 -<p> Former Professor of Education at Hofstra University, Dr. Timothy Smith believes that “states do not necessarily have poor education due to the lack of internet connection, however it is linked. Students have less of an ability to keep up with global standards when they can’t connect to the internet.” </p>

 -<p>EdWeek also recently did a story on Calhoun County, Mississippi that is claimed to have the “slowest internet in Mississippi.” In this article, there are stories where students spend whole classes staring at a loading screen. Where a lot of classroom materials are online now, waiting for internet connection to use these tools is wasting valuable time that could be spent learning. According to EdWeek, this is a problem found commonly in school districts that are in rural areas. </p>
 -
 -<p>In college, most of the projects and homework have some element that needs to be completed online. Not having a laptop and having to rely on the computers provided by the school can be a daunting task. Kyle Castoria, an engineering and physics student at Hofstra University, broke his laptop and hasn’t been able to afford to buy a new one for some time. He is having trouble keeping up with his work because he has to rely on finding a computer that has the correct software on campus. He says that, “many of the times the computer I need is already being used and I have to wait around for one to free up. This can take hours, and really wastes a lot of time that I could have spent finishing the work on my laptop at home. Luckily, with the internet connection at Hofstra I at least am assured the ability to connect. I can’t imagine how much harder it would be if I wasn’t even guaranteed that.” </p>
 -
 -<p>Dr. Smith comments on this by saying that while not having an internet connection does not always equate to bad grades, it makes simple tasks a lot harder for students who can’t do work at home. “It will take a lot more effort and a lot more time, and not every student has the luxury of leaving these open for school work.”</p>
 -
 -<p>These problems have not gone unnoticed by politicians and by President Obama who has started initiatives to try to make sure every school has access to the internet through a program called ConnectEd. He announced this initiative in June 2013, and vowed “that within the next 5 years, 99% percent of students would be connected to next- generation broadband and high- speed wireless in their school and libraries.” </p>
 -
 -<p>	However Obama has not only focused on schools, the offshoot of ConnectEd, ConnectHome, plans to increase internet access for low income families. On the website, ConnectHome is described as a “public- private collaboration to narrow the digital divide for families with school- age children who live in HUD- assisted housing.” It is considered to be the next step in Obama’s vow to close the digital divide. </p>
 -
 -<p>“This generation is claimed to have the whole world at its fingertips, however we have to account for the many that are left out,” said Dr. Smith. </p>
